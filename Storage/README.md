# Storage

This is a system for sorting items.

## `storage.json`

The `storage.json` configuration file dictates which items go into which chest.

## `layout.json`

The `layout.json` configuration file maps the logical chest names described in
`storage.json` with the physical chest names in the Minecraft world. This file
will need to be manually configured to line up with your individual situation.
